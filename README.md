# Home Advantage in Spanish La-Liga (2012-2023): The Impact of Attendance on Home Team Performance
## Abstract
The Spanish La Liga, one of football's most competitive leagues, with top teams vying for dominance has long fascinated fans and analysts alike. This study examines the relationships between team performance, stadium capacity, attendance and other factors in La Liga, utilizing data from Transfermarkt from 2012 to 2023. This analysis reveals significant correlations between various performance indicators, while surprisingly, attendance percentage – a metric reflecting average attendance relative to stadium capacity – has negligible impact on team success.  In contrast, findings also show that actual attendance and stadium capacity have a profound impact on team performance, suggesting that larger crowds and bigger stadiums can significantly influence a team's chances of success. This research helps to better understand the factors influencing team performance, providing useful information for teams looking to improve their results.
